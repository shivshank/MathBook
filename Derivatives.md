## Derivatives
Derivatives are the basis of your calc class, so you should know them well!

* The derivative of a function (that's a graph) tells you the slope of the function at a point.

When we graph lines (in the form {y=mx+b}), it's really easy to tell the slope, just look at the value of the {m} variable. Linear graphs (that's lines) are simple, so they have constant slope. Curves, however, are more complicated.

### Notation
Have you noticed that the notation for derivatives is horribly complicated and confusing? The two that I list here are the ones you probably need to know, but there are others.

**The Derivative with respect to:** When we take derivatives, we need to do it relative to one of the variables. But what the heck does "with respect to" mean?

#### {y'}
#### {(dy)/(dx)}
#### The others
Some people use one that looks like this:
{D_x(x^3 + 4x) = 3x^2 + 4}
Which means "The derivative with respect to x of {x^3 + 4x}."

### Higher Order Derivatives (f', f'', f''', f^4, etc)
