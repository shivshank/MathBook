# Overview
Here is a review of a bunch of classic calculus problems. This review is a your-exam's-coming-up-and-you-need-to-pass kind of review; it won't really explain the questions too much, but I will try to give you some good memorization tips and practical step-by-steps.

## Identifying Operations
Before we can continue, we need to check that you remember the basics. The following questions all ask you what operation is going on in the expression. For instance:
* |3 + 4| is addition
* |7 - 3| is subtraction
* |3^2| is "three squared", or to be technical it's exponentation/exponents

Questions:
* |3 * 4| _multiplication_
* |f(x)| _if |f| is a function, it means f of x_
* |5/3| _division, 5 divided by 3_
* |7(2)| _multiplication, 7 times 2, the same as |7 * 2|_
* |v(t)| _if |v| is a function, then it's |v| of |t|_
* |r(l)| _if |r| is a function, then it's |r| of |t|_
* |ab| _multiplication, a times b, as in |a * b|_
* |Gamma(f)| _if |Gamma| is a function, then it is |Gamma| of |f|_
* |d/(dx)[5x + 3]| _take the derivative of |5x + 3|_
* |sin(x)| _|sin| of |x|_
* |sinx| _|sin| of |x|, same as |sin(x)|_
* |sin^2x| _this is the same as |(sin(x))^2|_

Bonus:
* |3^(1/2)| _is |sqrt(3)|_
* |8^(-3)| _is |1/(8^3)|_

**Reminders:**
* "Whatever" of "whatever", such as |f(x)|, means plug |x| into the function |f|
* If you see a weird symbol, just go with it. Whatever alphabet you use behaves the same. For instance, |Gamma| is a greek letter, "gamma". So |Gamma(f)| is read "gamma of f." Another example: |2mu + 3mu = 5mu|
* The questions |r(l)|, |Gamma(f)|, and so on can mean two different things. You'll have to think a little and use context clues. If |r| is a variable, then |r(l)| just means |r * l|, but if it is a function, then it means |r| of |l|. The same goes for |Gamma|.
* **Fractions are divison. |5/3| is the same as |5 -: 3|**

## Exponents
A lot of people forget how crazy exponents work. Here's the main rules. Read each line and see if it makes sense. If it doesn't you should study ["exponent rules"](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/exponents-radicals).

 * |x^2 + x^3 = x^2 + x^3| (can't add things with different exponents)
 * |x^3 \* x^4 = x^7 = (x\*x\*x) \* (x\*x\*x\*x)|
 * |x^1/2 = sqrt(x)|
 * |(x^3)^4 = x^12| _note the parentheses_
 * |x^-1 = 1/x|
 * |x^-2 = 1/(x^2) = (x^2)^(-1)| _the negative means make it a fraction, but you keep the exponent_
 * |1/(x^-3) = x^3 = 1/(1/(x^3)) = 1 -: 1/x^3 = 1 * x^3/1| _remember "leave change flip"?_

I can't display them properly on this webpage, but here's a picture from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root) about nth roots:
