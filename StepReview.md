## Identifying Operations: some basic review (start here!)
Before we can continue, we need to check that you remember the basics. The following questions all ask you what operation is going on in the expression. For instance:
  * |3 + 4| is addition
  * |7 - 3| is subtraction
  * |3^2| is "three squared", or to be technical it's exponentiation/exponents

Questions:
  * |3 * 4| _multiplication_
  * |f(x)| _if |f| is a function, it means f of x_
  * |5/3| _division, 5 divided by 3_
  * |7(2)| _multiplication, 7 times 2, the same as |7 * 2|_
  * |v(t)| _if |v| is a function, then it's |v| of |t|_
  * |r(l)| _if |r| is a function, then it's |r| of |t|_
  * |ab| _multiplication, a times b, as in |a * b|_
  * |Gamma(f)| _if |Gamma| is a function, then it is |Gamma| of |f|_
  * |d/(dx)[5x + 3]| _take the derivative of |5x + 3|_
  * |sin(x)| _|sin| of |x|_
  * |sinx| _|sin| of |x|, same as |sin(x)|_
  * |sin^2x| _this is the same as |(sin(x))^2|_

Bonus (see the Exponents section for help):
  * |3^(1/2)| _is |sqrt(3)|_
  * |8^(-3)| _is |1/(8^3)|_

**Reminders:**
  * "Whatever" of "whatever", such as |f(x)|, means plug |x| into the function |f|
  * If you see a weird symbol, just go with it. Whatever alphabet you use behaves the same. For instance, |Gamma| is a greek letter, "gamma". So |Gamma(f)| is read "gamma of f." Another example: |2mu + 3mu = 5mu|
  * The questions |r(l)|, |Gamma(f)|, and so on can mean two different things. You'll have to think a little and use context clues. If |r| is a variable, then |r(l)| just means |r * l|, but if it is a function, then it means |r| of |l|. The same goes for |Gamma|.
  * Fractions are divison. |5/3| is the same as |5 -: 3|

## How do I simplify fractions?
Yep, this is some old stuff, but it can be hard and confusing and it's incredibly important. I'm going to give a quick refresher on **everything**.

A fraction has a top and a bottom, known as the numerator and denominator.

Fractions represent parts of a whole number. The numerator is how many parts we have and the denominator is how many parts we've **divided** the whole into.

**Example:** |1/3| means we divided one into three parts. You can't add denominators because the denominator doesn't mean anything on it's own, but you can add numerators if the denominators are the same.
  * |1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5|
  * |a/b + c/b = (a + c)/b|
  * Above we added "apples to apples" because both numbers were split into five parts.
  * We can't simplify |1/4 + 1/7| without doing more work.

**Multiplying fractions by a number:** |4 * 1/3| means "1/3 four times," also known as |1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3|, which by the above becomes: |4/3|.
  * |8*1/5 = 8/5|
  * |7*x/2 = (7x)/2|
  * |c*a/b = (ca)/b|
  * Likewise we can do the opposite: |(12x)/b = 12x/b|
  * |5/9 = 5 1/9| _1 is kinda like a "placeholder"_

**We can divide ANYTHING by one.** This means any number or function can be written as a fraction:
  * |81 = 81/1|
  * |3 + 4 = (3 + 4)/1|

**We can multiply ANYTHING by one.** And |n/n = 1| for any number |n|! This means we can multiply any number or function by a number over that number:
  * |4 = 4*3/3 = 12/3| _notice that |12/3| is the same as |4|_
  * |x + 3 = (x + 3) * 2/2 = (2(x + 3))/2|
  * |3 * x/x = (3x)/x|

**We can divide fractions!** |1/3| divided by two means that we have a whole split into 3 parts, then each part is split into two parts, for a total of six parts. In other words, |1/3 -: 2 = 1/6|. Since fractions are division, something |-: 2| means |1/2|, and we are left with |1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6|. Do you see the pattern?
  * |1/4 -: 3 = 1/4 \* 1/3 = 1/12|
  * |a/b -: c = a/b \* 1/c = a/(b*c)|

Now if we put it all together, we can multiply fractions. Recall that |3/4 = 3 1/4|. If we wanted to do |3/4 * 2/5|, we can work it out like this:
  * |3/4 * 2/5|
  * Notice |3/4 = 3 1/4| _pull the numerator out_
  * Notice |2/5 = 2 1/5| _pull the numerator out_
  * |3 1/4 \* 2 1/5| _substitute the above into the problem_
  * |3 \* 2 \* 1/4 \* 1/5| _the order of multiplication doesn't matter_
  * |6 \* 1/20| _simplify the left and the right_
  * |6/20| _put it back together_

**In short, you multiply the numerator with the numerator and the denominator with the denominator.**

**You can't add apples to oranges without generalizing:** Now we can simplify |1/4 + 1/7| if we make the denominators the same:
  * |1/4 \* 7/7 + 1/7 \* 4/4|
  * |7/28 + 4/28|
  * |(7 + 4)/(28)|
  * |11/28|

**What about parentheses?** All fractions have invisible parentheses around the top and bottom.
  * |(x^2 + 3)/(4+x) = ((x^2+4))/((4+x))|
  * |(a + b)/(c + d) * 3/5 = (3(a+b))/(5(c + d))|
  * |(x+3)/(8-x^2) \* (sqrt(x)+1)/(x-1) = ((x+3)(sqrt(x)+1))/((8-x^2)(x-1))|

## What are the derivative rules?
**Remember:** The derivative of |a +- b| is |a' +- b'| but the derivative of |a\*b| IS NOT |a' \* b'|, and the derivative of |a/b| is also not |(a')/(b')|.
 
The sum and difference rules (when you add and subtract):
  * The derivative of |a + b| is the same as the derivative of each added together.
  * |d/(dx)[a + b] = a' + b'|
  * |d/(dx)[a - b] = a' - b'|
  * Example:
  * |d/(dx)[3x + sin(x)] = 3 + cos(x)|

The constant multiple rule (when you multiply by a number):
  * You can pull constants out of derivatives, bascially.
  * So |d/(dx)3x^2| is the same as |3| times |d/(dx)x^2|, aka |6x|
  * |d/(dx)[684353567sin(x)] = 684353567cos(x)|
  * The derivative of a constant alone is zero, though:
  * |d/(dx)5 = 0|
  * You can only pull the constant out when there's more to the derivative.

The power rule:
  * |d/(dx)x^n = nx^(n-1)|
  * Examples:
  * |d/(dx)x^3 = 3x^2|
  * |d/(da)a^6 = 6a^5|
  * |d/(dx)2x^5 = 2 \* d/(dx)x^5 = 2 \* 5 \* x^4 = 10x^4| _pull the constant out_
  * This works for negative and fractional stuff too.
  * |1/x = x^-1| so |d/(dx)1/x = -x^-2|
  * |sqrt(x) = x^(1/2)| so |d/(dx)sqrt(x) = 1/2x^(-1/2)|

The product rule:
  * |d/(dx)[f(x)*g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)|
  * A lot of people say "the derivative of the first times the second plus the derivative of the second times the first."
  * I personally remember that it "flip-flops" while kind of picturing it in my head.
  * You use the product rule whenever you have 2 things multiplied.
  * |d/(dx)[x^2\*sin(x)] = 2x\*sin(x) + cos(x)\*x^2|
  * Here's a longer problem worked out:
  * |d/(dx)[5sin(x)tan(x)]|
  * That's three things multiplied. You could use the product rule several ways here. You can group 5 with sin(x), pull the 5 out entirely. I am going to group the 5 and sin together.
  * |d/(dx)[5sin(x)]tan(x) + 5sin(x)*d/(dx)tan(x)|
  * |5cos(x)tan(x) + 5sin(x)*((secx)^2)| _recall |d/(dx)tan(x) = (secx)^2|_

The quotient rule:
  * to do
  * A good saying is "low D high minus high D low over low squared" to remember the rule

For the chain rule, see the other section.

## When (and how) do I use the chain rule?

## How do I do implicit differentiation?

## What is the difference between |y'|, |d/(dx)|, and |(dy)/(dx)|?
Here is the key difference: |d/(dx)| is an "operator" and |y'| and |(dy)/(dx)| are functions. That means...?

More simply, |d/(dx)| means "take the derivative of":
  * |d/(dx)[(x+3)f(x)] = (x+3)f'(x) + f(x)| _use the product rule_
  * "Taking the derivative of" |y| gives us |y'|, so you can write: |d/(dx)y = y'|
  * And as we will see in a second: |d/(dx)y = (dy)/(dx)|
  
Secondly: |y'| and |(dy)/(dx)| mean the same thing. They are equivalent. If you write one, you can write the other.
  * |y' = (dy)/(dx)|
  * |d/(dx)y^2 = 2y(y') = 2y(dy)/(dx)| _use the chain rule_

Finally: |d/(dx)| and |(dy)/(dx)| are very confusing to many people because **they look like fractions, but they are not.** They are a whole symbol and must move together, despite appearing to behave like fractions sometimes.

## How do I find critical points, extrema, and inflection points?
I found some [simple examples here (ucsb.edu)](http://clas.sa.ucsb.edu/staff/lee/inflection%20points.htm). I'll be working out a more complex problem: if you can handle this one you can probably handle all the ones you'll encounter.

Vocab:
  * Stationary points -- where |f'(x) = 0|
  * Critical points -- where |f'(x) = 0| or |f'(x)| is undefined
  * Inflection points -- where |f''(x)| crosses the x axis
  * Extrema -- term for minimums and maximums

To find a minimum or a maximum of a function, you need to find the function's critical points. Let's do an example with the function: |f(x) = 4x^3 + 5x^2 + 2|. Since |f(x)| is never undefined, we just need to find |f'(x) = 0|. You should graph |f(x)| and |f'(x)| on your calculator.
  * |f(x) = 4x^3 + 5x^2 + 2|
  * |f'(x) = 12x^2 + 10x|

### Now let's find the critical points:
  * |0 = f'(x)|
  * |0 = 12x^2 + 10x| _substitute |f(x)|_
  * |0 = x(12x + 10)| _factor x_

Now, think: |0 = x(12x + 10)| is only true if |x = 0| or |12x + 10 = 0|. So now just solve those equations.

Thus, the critical points of |f(x)| are:
  * |x = 0|
  * |x = -5/6 lArr 12x + 10 = 0|

### To find the mins and maxes we can use the first derivative test:
Remember that a derivative gives us slope. We want to check if either of these points is a minimum or a maximum. A minimum is when the function stops decreasing (|f'| becomes positive) and a max is when the function stops increasing (|f'| becomes negative). The critical points tell us where the derivative touches zero, now we just need to see what's happening around there. We do this by checking what |f'| is for values between and around the critical points.

For |x = -5/6|, I will use the |x| values |-1| and |-1/2|
  * |f'(-1) = 2| _so |f| is increasing_
  * |f'(-1/2) = -2| _and then |f| is decreasing_
  * Therefore |x = -5/6| is a local maximum because |f| stops increasing

For |x = 0|, I will use the |x| values |-1/2| and |1|:
  * |f'(-1/2) = -2 | _so |f| is decreasing_
  * |f'(1) = 22| _and then |f| is increasing_
  * Therefore |x = 0| is a local minimum because |f| stops decreasing

### Finding Inflection Points
An inflection point is when a function starts accelerating or decelerating. This means that the slope of f (aka |f'|) is either increasing or decreasing. To find if |f'| is increasing or decreasing, we need to take the derivative of |f'|, also known as the second derivative of |f|.
  * |f(x) = 4x^3 + 5x^2 + 2| _this is what we started with_
  * |f'(x) = 12x^2 + 10x|
  * |f''(x) = 24x + 10|

For there to be an inflection point, |f''| must cross the x axis. This means we need to find the x-intercepts of |f''| (by setting it equal to zero) and then check if the sign of |f''| changes as we pass through the x-intercept.
  * |f''(x) = 0|
  * |rArr 24x + 10 = 0| _substitute the expression for |f''|_
  * |rArr 24x = -10|
  * |rArr x = -10/24 = -5/12|

And now we'll see if |f''| changes sign by checking two |x| values around |-5/12|:
  * |f''(0) = 10|
  * |f''(-1) = -14|
  * Therefore |x = -5/12| is an inflection point because |f''| changes sign.

As another problem, try finding the minimums, maximums, and inflection points of |x^3 + 2x^2|. Hover over this box for answers:

<div class="answers">
	<p>Derivatives:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>|f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2|</li>
		<li>|f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x|</li>
		<li>|f''(x) = 6x - 4|</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Extrema (when solving |f'(x) = 0|, don't forget to factor):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>|x=0|</li>
		<li>|x=4/3|</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The inflection point is at |x=2/3|</p>
</div>

## Types of Derivative Notation
There are many ways to write the derivative:
  * |y'| is "y prime", and means "the derivative of y"
  * |(dy)/(dx)| is often read "dee-why-dee-x" and is the same as |y'|
  * |d/(dx)[|whatever|]| means "take the derivative of whatever"

For example, the derivative of |y = 2x^3 + 4x| could be written:
  * |d/(dx)y = d/(dx)[2x^3 + 4x] = 6x^2 + 4|
  * |(dy)/(dx) = 6x^2 + 4|
  * |y' = 6x^2 + 4|
  * |y' = (dy)/(dx)|

Here is an equation showing a few more ways, but you probably don't need to know them:
  * |y' = (dy)/(dx) = D_x(y) = dot y|

If we are taking the derivative of |f(x)|, it's basically the same:
  * |f'(x) = (df)/(dx)(x) = d/(dx)[f(x)]|

Remember that we can take derivatives of derivatives:
  * the first derivative: |d/(dx)[x^3] = 3x^2|
  * the second derivative: |d/(dx)[3x^2] = 6x|
  * the derivative of |y'| is |y''|, is read "y double prime"

For the most part you can use the prime notation, like |y'|, but when doing things like implicit differentiation, |(dy)/(dx)| can save you trouble.

|D_x| and |(dy)/(dx)| have an |x| in them to tell us what we are differentiating "with respect to." This basically means the variable that is changing. This is super important (though technical) if you are trying to differentiate a general formula, such as |ax^2 + bx + c|. For instance:
  * |y = ax^2 + bx + c|
  * |(dy)/(dx) = 2ax + b|

All of the other variables |a|, |b|, and |c| are treated like constants.

## What is a Derivative?
When you take the derivative of an equation/function, you are creating a new function. When you plug a number into the derivative, you get the slope of the first function at that number.

**Example:** The derivative of |(y = 3x + 4)| is |(y' = 3)|. |y| is a line with slope 3, so |y'(|anything|) = 3|. Curves have changing slope. |x^2| is a parabola, which is a curve. It's derivative is |2x|, so you can see how it's slope changes depending on what x is.

The official definition is:
  * |f'(x) = lim_(h -> 0)(f(x+h) - f(x))/h|

This formula comes from the formula for slope, rise over run:
  * |m = (f(x_2) - f(x_1))/(x_2 - x_1)|

The slope formula requires two points, but derivatives take the slope at only a single point. If |x_2 = x_1|, then the slope is undefined, and that's where the limit part comes in. The limit basically allows us to find what the value of the slope would be if it wasn't undefined. We then define |h = x_2 - x_1|, which implies that |x_2 = h + x_1|. And boom, you got the derivative formula!

## When is a function undefined?
The only times that a function is undefined are when you divide by zero or take an even root (square root, fourth root, etc) of a negative number:
  * |1/x| is undefined when |x = 0|;
  * |x/(x + 2)| is undefined when |x + 2 = 0|, which means when |x = -2|
  * |sqrt(x)/3| is undefined when |x < 0|
  * |sqrt(x - 2)| is undefined when |x - 2 < 0|, which means when |x < 2|
  * |sqrt(x - 10)/x| is undefined when |x < 10| or |x = 0|

## Exponents and Exponent Rules
The basics: |x^n| means |x| times |x|, |n| times. For instance, |x^3 = x\*x\*x|.

A lot of people forget how crazy exponents work. Here's the main rules. Read each line and see if it makes sense. If it doesn't you should study ["exponent rules"](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/exponents-radicals).

 * |x^2 + x^3 = x^2 + x^3| (can't add things with different exponents)
 * |x^3 \* x^4 = x^7 = (x\*x\*x) \* (x\*x\*x\*x)|
 * |x^1/2 = sqrt(x)|
 * |(x^3)^4 = x^12| _note the parentheses_
 * |x^-1 = 1/x|
 * |x^-2 = 1/(x^2) = (x^2)^(-1)| _the negative means make it a fraction, but you keep the exponent_
 * |1/(x^-3) = x^3 = 1/(1/(x^3)) = 1 -: 1/x^3 = 1 * x^3/1| _remember "leave change flip"?_

I can't display them properly on this webpage, but here's a picture from the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nth_root) about nth roots:
![nth root of x](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/6/e/f6e2875466bdf9e5eb4a7db071b8e812.png)

The above is what happens when you have a fractional exponent. If you have a negative fractional exponent, just do |1/(...)| and replace the "..." by following the above rule.
