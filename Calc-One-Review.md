# Calculus One: Review Guide

This guide is meant to be as comprehensive as possible. I hope it helps! Note, though, each topic may assume you know bits of other topics since it's review. For instance, when I talk about middle school algebra I might bring in examples from your last day of calc class (to bring it all together).

1. Doing Math Problems
1. Slope
1. Functions and Variables
    * Transformations
    * Common Functions
        * Arithmetic
        * Polynomials
        * Logarithms (ln, log)
        * Radicals
1. Derivatives
    * Tangent Lines
    * Notation
    * Higher Order Derivatives (f', f'', f''', f^4, etc)
    * Stationary Points (f'=0, implies min, max, or inflection)
    * Critical Points (f'=0 or f' = DNE, signals a Vertical Asymptote or local extreme, aka min/max)
    * Inflection Points (f''=0 & f'' changes sign, signals concavity change)
    * Concavity
1. Fraction Review
1. Limits
    * The concept
    * Direct Substituion

1. Trig (aka Trigonometry)
    * Sin, Cos, Sec, Csc, Tan, Cot
    * Inverse trig functions, reciprocal trig functions
    * Soh Cah Toa
1. Applications of Derivatives
    * Finding Minimums and Maximums (Extrema)
